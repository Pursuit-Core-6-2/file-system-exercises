/*
  Write code that reades the file `my-files.txt` and groups all files in the list by the extension: "zip", "pdf" etc. Once grouped write your result to a json file called `files-ext-map.json`.

  Take a look at the file `expectedResult.json` inside this directory. You want to write a program that produces a json file like that one.
